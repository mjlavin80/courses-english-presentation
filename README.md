# markdown slides for my Digital Brown Bag

DMAP Director Matt Lavin's talk "Using the Department's New Online Pedagogy Repository." Matt's workshop will walk us through the new site: https://courses.english.pitt.edu, a searchable online storage space for English department course materials including syllabi and assignments. Additionally, the workshop will demonstrate how to sign up to contribute materials and will solicit feedback on user interaction with the site's content and how to improve user experience. The site is already an expansive and rich resource for instruction materials across the four-programs and Matt's workshop will highlight its many benefit and future possibilities for our department community. This Brown Bag will take place on Friday September 15 from 12:30-1:30 PM in CL435 (Digital Media Lab)
